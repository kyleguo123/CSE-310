# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}
I have created a firebase and connect it with my personal webside and my sprint 1 project.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
Using firebase for this sprint, it's one of part that I need to my big project. It will help me to update the current stock price on my website.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}
I'm using firebase.
{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
I created my firebase python file and connected to my personal firebase account. In the firebase python file, I have made a function that it will connect to my last project (get currenct price funtion). Once the stock price has changed, it will update to my firebase, and it will also change the number on my website.

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
ChatGPT, firebase tutoral
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
