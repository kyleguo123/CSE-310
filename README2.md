# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
In my program, I am sepcific to analyzing ETHUSDT. I wrote a algorithm by using EMA strategy. According to this alforithm, it will help me to analyz when would be the good time to buy or sell my stock. 
    Here is the link that i get all of data: https://www.binance.com/en

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}
